# The L-function of an elliptic curve

In this file, we define the L-function of an elliptic curve.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Lfunction`: the L-function of a minimal Weierstrass equation.

/-- The L-function of an elliptic curve is the product over places of `1 / fₚ(‖p‖⁻ˢ)` where:
* `fₚ = 1 - aₚ T + ‖p‖ T ^ 2` if `E` has good reduction at `p`,
* `fₚ = 1 - T` if `E` has split multiplicative reduction at `p`,
* `fₚ = 1 + T` if `E` has nonsplit multiplicative reduction at `p`,
* `fₚ = 1` if `E` has additive reduction at `p`.
